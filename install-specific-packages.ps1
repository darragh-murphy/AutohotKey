# Export installed packages to another computer
# Chocolatey supports installing applications with packages.config file, but unfortunately Chocolatey doesnâ€™t have a command to create the config file from local packages.
# One easy way to export installed packages is to create a PowerShell script that has an install command for each package.
# choco list --idonly | % { "choco install -y " + $_ } > Install.ps1

# Install Chocolatey (if not already installed)
if (-not (Get-Command choco -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) {
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
